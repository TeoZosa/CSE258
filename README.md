# Marvel Vs. DC: Predicting Consumer Similarity Using Latent Factor Models

Using data personally scraped from Amazon.
com, I performed a sentiment analysis and generated
a star-rating predictor from DC Comics and Marvel
Comics graphic novel reviews. I show that sentiment for
both publishers is essentially positive and that the latent
factor model performance degrades when predicting
user-item ratings for graphic novels from one publisher
to another; a finding that suggests there is a qualitative
difference between graphic novels produced by these two
publishers.
